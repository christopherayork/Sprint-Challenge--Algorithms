#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n)

b)
O(n^3)

c)
O(n)
## Exercise II
Go through each floor starting from the first floor and drop a single egg.
If it doesnt break, go up a floor and drop another one.
Once an egg breaks, you've found f, remember that and you're done.

The runtime complexity of this is O(n) at worst, almost definitely less in reality
